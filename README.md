## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to present investors with a bike trip analysis of NYC Citibikes to show that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 

## Results

### Top Starting Locations

The first image above is a map illustrates the top Citibike starting locations in NYC, where users pick up their bikes to begin their ride. Although NYC is a different city than Des Moines, it is useful to see what types of areas where bike pickups are located. 

### Number of Bike Rides by Start Time

Here is a bar chart of the Number of Bike Rides by Start Time. It illustrates that the most popular time to start riding is at 5 pm, with 224,566 riders, shortly followed by 6 pm with 215,783 riders. 8 am is in third place, closely followed by 7 pm as the most popular time to start riding a Citibike. The least popular times are in the wee hours of the morning. 

### Checkout Times for Users

The above graph illustrates checkout times for users. The most popular length of time for a bike trip is only 5 minutes long. Once the trip becomes an hour or longer, the amount of users drops significantly. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

The above line graph illustrates checkout times by gender. The most popular checkout time for women is 6 minutes, with with 34,151 female users. The most popular checkout time for men is 5 minutes, with 108,087 male users. There are fewer users of unknown gender, who tend to take slightly longer bike rides. 

### Trips by Weekday Per Hour
<img width="1015" alt="Screen Shot 2021-10-03 at 4 14 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85920136/135775150-cee605f3-b0d6-45bf-8fb8-607fb406fd64.png">
The above heatmap illustrates the number of trips by weekday per hour. The legend displays the color assignment for the heatmap. Light orange shows a minimum of 360 trips, and dark orange-red illustrates up to 44,905 trips. It is apparent that 5 and 6 pm are the most common times for trips, and that the wee hours of the morning are the least popular times. 

### Trips by Gender
<img width="1018" alt="Screen Shot 2021-10-03 at 4 18 00 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85920136/135775237-d61abcfb-42cc-421b-9d7f-95fc7d4b0f9a.png">
The above heatmap shows trips by weekday per hour by gender. In the link, there is a sliding bar that allows the viewer to see all genders. It is clear that men make up the majority of users by the concentration of orange red on their chart. The females chart has a similar distrubution as the male chart, but in a lighter shade of orange. Both men and women tend to ride more during the weekday peak traffic hours. Users of unknown gender tend to ride Citibikes slightly more often on the weekend. 

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
<img width="1011" alt="Screen Shot 2021-10-03 at 4 23 58 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85920136/135775377-0acfbbba-c15e-44ff-b9dd-34044d3f551e.png">
The above heatmap illustrates user trips by gender by weekday, and a breakdown between subscribers and customers. The legend displays the color coding of the heatmap: from seafoam green at the low point of 3,528 users and dark indigo at 259,316 users. It is apparent that the most trips are taken by male subscripers, followed by female subscribers. 

### Top Ending Locations

The final image is a map of Top Ending Locations in NYC. It is very similar to the Top Starting Locations. It's helpful to see what destinations people are riding to. 

## Summary
The results of my analysis is that the biggest group of users in NYC are male subscribers who most likely ride Citibikes on their commute home from work, which takes about 5 minutes. 
For further research, I would include Trips by Weekday per Hour in January, to see how much a difference there is in usage. I would also look at Checkout Times for Users in January as well. In addition, New York City is not a valid comparison to Des Moines, IA. For additional research, I would find bike trip data for a smaller, more rural town comparable with Des Moines.
